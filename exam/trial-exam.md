# Trial exam

A trial exam will be available in inspera from Tuesday 21. April 8a.m. until Sunday 26th April 18p.m..

Your deliveries from Inspera will be looked at, but not graded or corrected in detail. The goal of the trial exam is for you to get more familiar with how the exam will be held, what you have to learn and how to use inspera. 

Based on the exam, you can also give feedback or ask questions.

Submitting the trial exam is not mandatory. However:
- **On the last page of the exam, you have to create a zip archive out of your delivery and upload it. Everyone should try out this functionality.**
It may make sense to time, how long it takes, since you have to complete this upload before the end of the exam.

From next week, the questions and solutions from the trial exam will be available [here](.). The trial exam is meant to be solved within 4 hours.

Good luck, 

Leander
